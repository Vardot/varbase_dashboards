# Optional

Moved optional configurations to managed directory so that we could 
manage activating number of configurations based on the status of dependencies.

If the Varbase Dashboards was installed on a site, but the Comment, or
Taxonomy modules were not enabled, the system will load the configurations
when they are enabled.
